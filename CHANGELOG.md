### Fixed

* improved logging

## [3.0.0] - 2024-06-04

### Added

* added a standard+jstack option for the --collects flag

### Changed

* removed ttop and replaced it with `LINES=100 top -H -n <iterations> -p <pid> -d <interval> -bw` 
* will try and use `kubectl` for file transfers and command execution if present, but for cluster discovery and the k8s rights check the api is still used, use the `-d` flag to disable this behavior and just use the Kubernetes api directly.
* unhide most of the hidden flags so that people can use the more advanced features if they want
* in k8s pod tarball transfer now increases with node count (coordinators will have more queries.json size) the base is still 30 minutes but we add a minute for every 3 pods

### Fixed

* CTRL+C cancels all running processes and remote calls also executes any file or folder cleanup that was pending
* ignoring errors when searching for cluster ID as high usage clusters have files vanish during search
* improved timeout error messages

## [2.4.3] - 2024-04-25

### Changed

* removing sys.boot and sys.cache.objects from health check capture

## [2.3.0] - 2024-03-28

### Changed

* the default job profiles is now 20 for everything except the health check where it remains 25000. This default only works if
someone has added the PAT which is always available
* moved all rest API calls to the start of the process. This is to minimize the amount of operations that fails if a token expires.

## [2.3.0-rc3] - 2024-03-26

### Fixed

* was using move instead of copy for fallback strategy

## [2.3.0-rc2] - 2024-03-21

### Added

* added a --label-selector flag for the kubernetes pods which follows the standard [kubernetes approach](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors), this is entirely optional and will use the current default if nothing is specified
* show the collection arguments used for DDC

* fixed more output for batch mode

## [2.3.0-beta3] - 2024-03-21

### Added

* retry logic for copy from 
* high hard-coded timeouts for copy from and copy to pod, if someone really wants this to be configurable we accept PRs

## [2.3.0-beta2] - 2024-03-20

### Fixed

* logging had extra whitespaces in it and this broke the output for the UX, cleaning this out now
* logging only individual lines instead of groups of lines together as was possible with kubernetes output, now logging output for k8s should be more logical

## [2.3.0-beta1] - 2024-03-19

### Added

* fine grained updates of job status
* fallback to local collect only when trying to collect with `--detect-namespace` and `--disable-prompt`

### Changed

* --transfer-flag for advanced users of the ddc command to override the hard coded value

## [2.1.1] - 2024-02-23

### Added

* more logging on retrieval of dremio home and log directories
* storing ps output from autodetection in diag tarball under the node-info
* log rate of reading files when searching for cluster ID

### Fixed

* error message when findClusterID failed was confusing
* sanitizing intput from autodetection of dremio home, conf and log directories

## [2.1.0] - 2024-02-15

### Added

* retries=5 added to the kubectl cp command
* limit number of transfers of tarballs to 2 at once to help with system or bandwidth limitations

## [2.0.1] - 2024-02-14

* will fail ddc if we use a --tarball-out-dir or a --transfer-dir that has any entries besides: ddc, ddc.log, ddc.yaml or nodeName.tar.gz

### Fixed
* fixed not actually allowing the DREMIO_LOG_DIR to be used 

## [0.8.3] - 2023-12-21

* failing validiation of the dremio log directory
* will fail the collect if log directory only has one file or is inaccessible
* will fail the collect if conf directory is empty or inaccessible
* no longer require executor be given to the ddc command, but we still require a coordinator

### Fixed
* no longer logging we stopped an existing JFR recording when we didn't

## [0.7.4] - 2023-11-22
### Fixed

* AWSE coordinator/executor detection changed - now checks for coordinator first
* JFR now attempts a silent stop for existing DDC JFR recordings, this will clean up any collections that had not been properly stopped

## [0.7.3] - 2023-11-09
### Fixed

* now copy, archive, and delete copy instead of archive in place log files #130
* unexpected use of tmp path #123

### Fixed

* Windows collection and the ability to run tests on Windows

## [0.6.0] - 2023-07-13

### Added

* flag to specify the Dremio pid
* flag to control collection of jvm flags
* flag to control os information collection
* flag to pick up ddc.yaml from a specified directory when running the remote collecting `ddc` command
* flag to disable rest api calls
* ddc awselogs - automates log collection for awse instead of requiring remote connections one can run just this one command from any node where the /var/efs/logs directory is located and get all logs for each node
* we now store the output of kubectl log from each container on all pods that are matched
* added --transfer-flag to change the output directory for ddc and tarball captures. This should allow dealing with limits in partition size to be dealt with

### Changed

* development for ddc now requires a kubernetes cluster
* when used with the main ddc command --dremio-pat-prompt one will receive a password prompt. This password will be sent to all nodes. This removes the need for adding --dremio-pat-token to the yaml
* when using `ddc local-collect --dremio-pat-token ""` the user will receive password prompt
* executors now have --disable-rest-api passed to them instead of a blank --dremio-pat-token
* we now only look for ddc.yaml before we considered a bunch of different configuration file types, this will allow us to simplify out configuration code at a later date
* with the new ability to specify where the transfer files are stored, we no longer brute force delete the transfer folder (which was /tmp/ddc and therefore very safe to delete), we now only delete ddc, ddc.yaml and the tarball that matches the host name from the remote node, this will prevent people from deleting all of their data directory for example)

### Fixed

* when --dremio-pat-token was used it would show up the argument in some logs, this has been corrected
* job profile collection was reporting collected profiles even when they errored out
* dremio-env now has the correct has the correct name of dremio-env
* parsing was silently failed when ddc.yaml had an incorrect format or syntax error, this has been resolved.

### Added

* added "ttop" reporting for local-collect which allows reporting on the threads in java by cpu usage and gc allocation rate
* now have dremio-cloud support 

### Fixed

* fixed broken thread pool that was not limiting work at all, now have test to detect this now
* windows development now functions
* added some type assertions around the handling of maps to prevent bugs

### Changed

* if table is missing from system table capture now it will just skip it, this means better handling of different versions.
* less chatty logs and we now have simplified logging of progress in ddc

## [0.4.0] - 2023-06-16

### Added

* configuration options using --rest-http-timeout for setting request timeout during rest collection
* DDC Linux is now embedded in the Windows and Mac versions of DDC, this means one less binary to move around

### Fixed

* gc logs now respect log age (default 7 days)
* windows collection was broken with ddc, this is now fixed
* executor capture was broken on ssh due to difference in argument parsing between k8s and ssh
* sudo now is respected when copying files back and forth with ssh installs

## [0.3.1] - 2023-06-07

### Added

* support for untrusted certs when accessing the dremio API

### Fixed

* We were logging WARN messages for unsupported kinds, we are ignoring those now and there will be a debug log that explains we are not masking those kinds

### Changed

* if unable to detect any dremio PID process we will now exit with an error that states one must run sudo to run collections
* several warnings have the text error in them, this was leading to people thinking there was an error when really it is just a warning that may or may not be significant
* REST calls now only occur on the first coordinator and will not occur on subsequent nodes

## [0.3.0] - 2023-06-02

### Added

* logs now stream from the nodes capturing this give a sense of progress
* added k8s json file password masking
* password masking for dremio.conf
* prevent collection when invalid k8s or ssh is given

### Fixed

* if no gc log is set or found the gc log collection skips
* gclog detection was running on the root ddc command, this has been
  moved to a later evaluation time than the init() command
* was removing the test tmp dir by accident
* fixed a race in the cli that lead to it exiting when streaming before all data had been written out

### Changed

* jps -v is now used to parse startup flags, this works more
  consistently than ps -f
